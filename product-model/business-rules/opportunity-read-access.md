# Workspace members may read the record — opportunity

The grant follows this opportunity’s Workspace: its owner through ownership, or its own Membership through the assigned role. Disclosure remains scoped to that resolved workspace; the Task digest’s unattended reads use its separate eligibility derivation. On REST token-bearing requests the actual selected credential must hold the corresponding read/create/update/delete ability; Passport cookie credentials are refused. On MCP OAuth the selected credential must hold mcp:use, while personal tokens require the operation ability. Session-only REST calls follow their inspected policy path. Ownership of some other credential never qualifies the request.
