# Workspace members may read workspace information

Membership or ownership is checked against this workspace; public shipped information is not private Workspace disclosure. On REST token-bearing requests the actual selected credential must hold the corresponding read/create/update/delete ability; Passport cookie credentials are refused. On MCP OAuth the selected credential must hold mcp:use, while personal tokens require the operation ability. Session-only REST calls follow their inspected policy path. Ownership of some other credential never qualifies the request.
